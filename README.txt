MESBGProbabilties
Background: I wanted to determine the probable results of shooting in MESBG, a tabletop battle game. 
There are 3 basic steps to determining if the archer wounds the target.
1. To Hit: Each model has a value they need to roll or higher to hit.
2. In Way: Depending on what is between the archer and the target, a die is rolled to see if the archer might hit something that is in the way of the target
3. To Wound: You compare the Bow strengh to the target Defence on the Wound Chart to see what value is needed to wound the target.
There are several modifyers depending on the archer:
1. Might: In game, might is used to increace the value of a die, msking it more likley to achieve goal
2. Rerolls: There are many types of rerolls depending on the model.   

Instructions:
1. Choose Archer
	a. if you want to manualy create archer, select manual
	b. Enter in values to fields
	c. If there are rerolls a box will apear to determine what rerolls are used
	d. If either all to hit or all to wound is selected then the coresponding ones to wound will be and dissabled
2. Give information describing the shot.
	Note: In game, heros use might can be used to increace the value of one die roll. In calculating probability I had might used on every roll.
3. Choose Target
	a. if you want to manualy create target, manual
	b. Enter in values to fields
